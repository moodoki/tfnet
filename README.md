TFNet2
=====


TFNet 2018 updated to run with current tensorflow, uses Estimators, can run
with MirroredStrategy on multiple GPUs

## Known Issues

Training with current CUFFT/tf.signal.irfft may result in NaNs during training.
Seems to be dataset dependent and will recover without problems if ran again
(continue from last saved checkpoint). Current train script attempts to
automatically detect this and restart training if NaNs are encountered.


Data Preparation
================

##VCTK-Corpus
1. Download and extract VCTK-Corpus
2. Run `DATAROOT=/path/to/VCTK/wav48 TXT_ROOT=dataset_txt/vctk data_prepration/gen_all_rate.sh`


Training
========

Baselines can be generated by running `make tfnet_baselines`.

Run `make -n` to see actual commands executed.
